I do have a few wishes in mind.

1) A nice install script would be benefical to new users.  I'm imagining something that walks them through setting up the database and defining usernames and passwords for this program.

2) The program could benefit from a better templating system to allow for easier customization.

3) A graphical overhaul could be needed some day. I'm more of a back-end programmer than a gui person.

4) An import page.  Email me for my ideas on how to implement it.

Those are my ideas for now. Hopefully there will be more ideas in the future :)
